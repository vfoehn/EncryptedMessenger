In this package we distinguish two types of classes:
 1) Usable classes
 2) Stringifiable classes
 
"Usable classes" contain fields with the most convenient types. For example, a public key has type 
PublicKey. However, in order to write objects to disk or send them in a message we introduce 
"stringifiable classes". As the name implies, objects of these classes can easily be stringified. 
In our case, we use Gson to convert objects into the Json format. In order for this to be possible
all fields must be initializable using the default constructor. Therefore, we change the types of 
some fields. For instance, we convert the public key to a String and store it as such.
 
Stringifiable classes are only used for reading/writing objects from/to disk and sending messages.
For example, when we load an account from disk, we first create a StringifiableAccount object and 
subsequently use this to create a (regular) Account object.
